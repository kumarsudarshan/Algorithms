We have discussed Backtracking and Knightâ€™s tour problem in Set 1.
Let us discuss Rat in a Maze as another example problem that can be solved using Backtracking.

A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1].
A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.

In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination.
Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem.
For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions and a more complex version can be with a limited number of moves.
input:
{1, 0, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 0, 1}
{0, 1, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 1, 1}

Following is the solution matrix (output of program) for the above input matrix.
{1, 0, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 0, 0}
{0, 1, 0, 0}
{0, 1, 1, 1}
All entries in solution path are marked as 1.
